ok, so assumpt that I knew Powershell scripts 
I wrote a script that can delete a share folder, after that I implement it to my C# wizard which will call 
my script at the end of its run so basically at the GUI that shared folder hasn't been deleted yet but in the end...
how to make user see that folder is deleted at that time but actually been deleted after that ?
